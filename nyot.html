    <h3>About New York On Tech</h3>

    <p> New York On Tech (NYOT) prepares the next generation of technology leaders emerging from New York City 
    by creating pathways for underrepresented students to thrive in technology and innovation.</p>
      
    <p> This project was created as part of NYOT's TECH360 Squad program: a free, nine week after-school program 
    for 10th, 11th and 12th graders enrolled in New York City high schools. Students enrolled in the program learn 
    the fundamentals of web design and development. Courses take place at companies in New York City and are taught
    by tech professionals. </p>
    
    <p>The past nine weeks have been fun! I really enjoyed learning about the basics of web design and development.
    This program has taught me that anyone can be part of the technology industry!</p>
