        <h3>Vicente Gomez, Students at the Williamsburg High School for Architecture and Design</h3>

        <p>I was born on October 9th, 1999 at 7:42pm in Brooklyn Hospital in Downtown Brooklyn. For the next 3 years of my life, I lived in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where is still go to school to this day. I have 2 little brothers, Sammy and Emilio, and one little sister, Melina. Sammy is 13 years old, Emilio is 10, and Melina is 8. I currently go to school at the Williamsburg High School for Architecture and Design where I major in Computer Aided Design. I am a senior and intend on studying Computer Science when I go to college next year. </p>

        <p> Extracurricular activites have always played an important role in my life. Life isnt simply about work and education, you have to have fun sometimes. The majority of my extracurricular activities take place during the school year. I am in a program called SkillsUSA. SkillsUSA is a leadership program that pairs students with teachers to make the next generation of the workforce.</p>
